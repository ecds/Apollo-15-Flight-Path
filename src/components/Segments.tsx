    <Paragraph>
      The Apollo 15 Learning Hub is a project in the Emory Center for Digital
      Scholarship that has as its mission to assemble, preserve, and make
      available primary source records of Apollo 15 for research, education, and
      preservation as an example of a unique human endeavor. The Hub offers
      access to a digital archive of Apollo 15 onboard materials, an interactive
      3D model of the Lunar Module, as well as links to reliable primary sources
      of Apollo history. In this section of the Apollo 15 Learning Hub, we
      present information about the flight path of Apollo 15 to the Moon and
      back. The original flight documents presented here are part of the
      Learning Hub’s collection and were provided by Commander David R. Scott.

    <Paragraph>
      NASA’s Apollo program started in the 1960s and continued into the early
      1970s, achieving the first and only human missions around the moon,
      including six lunar landing missions, with the first moon landing of
      Apollo 11 being the most famous. The Apollo 15 mission was the fourth
      lunar landing mission and the first extended scientific exploration of the
      moon. The Apollo 15 mission involved several groundbreaking scientific
      experiments as well as innovative space travel features.
    </Paragraph>
    <Paragraph>
      The four primary objectives of the Apollo 15 mission in terms of science
      and engineering were to explore the Hadley-Apennine region of the Moon,
      set up and activate surface scientific experiments, make engineering
      evaluations of new Apollo equipment, and conduct lunar orbital experiments
      and photographic tasks .

      The crew of Apollo 15 was now embarking on the next phase – the first
      extended scientific exploration of the Moon -- NASA was to term our
      mission “the most complex and carefully planned expeditions in the history
      of exploration.” (Scott, 2011:p.1){" "}
    </Blockquote>
    <Paragraph>
      On March 26, 1970 NASA announced the crew for Apollo 15, which was planned
      to be the fifth Moon landing mission. The three astronauts selected for
      the mission were David R. Scott, the mission commander, Alfred M. Worden,
      and James B. Irwin.
    </Paragraph>
    <Paragraph>
      The Apollo 15 crew and their backups underwent training that lasted about
      20 months before their mission. Part of that training took place in
      Antarctica for a habitability study in January 1970, as the following
      video donated by Commander David Scott shows.
    </Paragraph>
    <Blockquote>
      A NASA contingent of six visited the Antarctica from the 9th through the
      15th of January [1970] for the purpose of assessing environmental
      conditions and observing scientific investigations in progress under the
      United States Antarctic Research Program (USARP). (Scott, 1970:p.8){" "}

    <Paragraph>
      Extensive geology training was another part of the process, with training
      exercises in the Orocopia Mountains and the Mojave Desert in California
      and the area around Flagstaff, Arizona, among other places. Apollo 15
      would also be the first mission to utilize the Lunar Roving Vehicle (LRV)
      to enable the astronauts to travel farther from their Lunar Module to
      explore areas of geologic interest.

    <StickyHeader>Launch</StickyHeader>
    <Paragraph>
      The Apollo 15 mission launch date had been scheduled for July 26, 1971.
      The last few weeks before the launch, the astronauts’ training as it
      related to the launch and everything else about the mission had
      intensified. Every detail about the flight plan, the Command and Service
      Module (CSM), the plan of action after the CSM had left the Earth’s
      atmosphere was exhaustively examined and checked.
    </Paragraph>
    <Blockquote>
      The planning and preparation for our mission had been so thorough that
      there was no doubt in our minds that we really knew “how to fly to the
      Moon” -- and in any conceivable situation. (Scott, 2008:p.1)

    <Paragraph>
      The Apollo 15 crew and their backups had been placed in quarantine for two
      weeks before the launch to ensure that they would not contract any viruses
      and that they would be in peak physical condition at the time of the
      flight. On the day of the launch, the crew started their day by undergoing
      a thorough physical exam by the mission doctors.
    </Paragraph>
    <Paragraph>
      Scott, Worden, and Irwin were helped into their spacesuits several hours
      before the launch. They had to wait for NASA technicians to finish the
      final check of the launch vehicle while wearing their spacesuits, which
      took the whole morning of that day. Finally, the three crew members
      entered the CSM. After the crew had entered the CSM a new round of checks
      followed.

    <StickyHeader>Ascent</StickyHeader>
    <Paragraph>
      The ascent of the spacecraft was one of the most dangerous parts of the
      whole mission. There were a number of things that could go wrong during
      this phase that could force Commander Scott to take the decision to abort
      the mission. What made this part of the flight even more stressful was the
      difficulty of replicating the ascent of the CSM in a flight simulator. The
      time-frame within which an abort could be activated was less than a
      second.
    </Paragraph>
    <Blockquote>
      And at any point in the mission, the crew had to be prepared to operate on
      their own without any contact from Earth, using only the equipment and
      computers on board and some pre-calculated maneuver data. (Scott,
      2008:p.4).

      The following cue card that was donated by Commander David Scott to the
      Apollo 15 Learning Hub shows two different abort procedures that Commander
      Scott would need to initiate if the crew ran into unresolvable trouble
      (NASA, 1971e:p.7).

      The cue cards inside the LM and CSM were used to provide necessary

      in different situations and under different conditions. For example, the
      following cue card, also provided by Commander Scott, shows the steps that
      the crew had to follow in case communication was lost with mission control
      back in Houston (NASA, 1971e:p.2)

      The Apollo 15 space craft safely went through the various stages of the
      ascent from earth without encountering any issues that could jeopardize
      the safety of the crew. When the space craft was out of the Earth’s
      atmosphere and into orbit, Mission Control and the Apollo 15 crew realized
      that they had gone through this dangerous part of the flight without any
      problems.

    <StickyHeader>Moon Landing</StickyHeader>
    <Paragraph>
      When the Apollo 15 Command and Service Module (CSM) “Endeavor” entered the
      Moon’s orbit, David Scott and James Irwin descended to the Moon in their
      Lunar Module, the vehicle that was designed to transport them from the CSM
      to the surface of the Moon.
    </Paragraph>
    <Paragraph>
      They flew their Lunar Module to a perfect landing 104 hours, 42 minutes,
      and 29 seconds after launch (6:16 pm EDT on July 30) at Hadley Rille about
      550 meters (about 1800 feet) north and slightly east of the targeted
      landing point. They touched down with two of the Lunar Module’s landing
      pads just over the edge of a small crater, causing the lunar module to
      tilt (NASA 1971, 62-63). But they were stable enough to continue their
      mission. They landed in the Apennine Range, a high, sloped area that
      permitted diverse opportunities for geological exploration and sampling
      (NASA 1971, 14).

      The following cue card, which is also part of the Apollo 15 Learning Hub’s

      It took Apollo 15 104 hours since they left Earth to reach the Moon’s
      surface. After they landed on the Moon, Commander Scott removed the upper
      hatch of the LM, stood on the engine cover and spent 33 minutes
      photographing the surroundings and describing what he saw to scientists in
      Houston. This procedure was known as a SEVA (Stand-Up Extra Vehicular

    <Paragraph>
      After they had taken some rest following their landing on the Moon, Scott
      and Irwin unfolded and deployed their Lunar Roving Vehicle (LRV) or simply
      "lunar rover" the following day. Specially designed for operation at 1/6
      Earth’s gravity, it could carry 180 pounds of astronauts, gear and samples
      on the Moon (which would weigh 1,080 pounds on Earth), more than twice the
      rover’s weight (NASA 1971, 248). It greatly expanded the amount of ground
      the Astronauts could traverse during their extravehicular activities
      (EVAs).
    </Paragraph>
    <Blockquote>
      We quickly discover, locomotion on the moon has its own peculiar
      restrictions. At one-sixth of earths gravity, we weigh only a sixth our
      normal poundage. Our gait quickly evolves into a rhythmic, bouncing motion
      that possesses all the lightness and ease of strolling on a trampoline
      (Scott, 1973:p.327).
    </Blockquote>
    <Paragraph>
      Describing his experience driving the lunar rover on the Moon’s surface,
      Commander Scott writes:
    </Paragraph>
    <Blockquote>
      the Lunar Roving Vehicle (LRV) ... meant significantly greater exploration
      capability, especially the capability to range to several different
      geologic areas from the Lunar Module, significantly more scientific
      equipment and experiments, and quite importantly, a mobile TV camera to
      view and record the distant activities of the crew. As a result, using a
      rover to explore multiple geologic areas at one landing site became almost
      equivalent to exploring multiple landing sites without a rover.
      Correspondingly, subsequent Apollo crews became even more proficient in
      “planetary field geology.” (Scott, 2008:p.XXIX)
    </Blockquote>
    <Paragraph>
      The importance of the geological study of the Lunar surface was
      highlighted by the intense training in geology that the Apollo crew
      members had to undergo
    </Paragraph>
    <Blockquote>
      Among the 30 original astronauts, none (0) had any formal geology training
      - NASA had to teach pilots how to be proficient planetary field
      geologists; adding science to engineering as a primary discipline. Again,
      the NASA training was superb; and because of their previous spaceflight
      experience, the mission Commanders had a major role in planning the
      training. And after many hours of practical and effective geology training
      (classroom, laboratory, and field), the results justified the selection
      and training process (Scott, 2011:p.XXX)

    <Paragraph>
      The Apollo 15 mission was the first one that provided astronauts with a
      vehicle to facilitate movement across the landscape of the Moon (NASA
      1971, 100). Having the lunar rover allowed Scott and Irwin to complete
      over 18 hours of exploration and to travel 27.9 kilometers (just over 17
      miles) on the Moon’s surface during the three days (from July 31 to August
      2) they spent on the Moon. The two astronauts were also able to collect
      approximately 170 pounds of lunar samples and to provide extensive oral
      descriptions and photographic documentation of geologic features in the
      vicinity of the landing site (NASA 1971, 2-3).

      Despite the usefulness of the lunar rover, the astronauts conducted most
      of their geology exploration of the Moon’s surface walking, which turned
      out be rather challenging given the lower gravity of the Moon.
    </Paragraph>
    <Paragraph>
      One of the most important aspects of the Apollo 15 mission was the study
      of the Moon’s geology, which was still not well understood at the time of
      the mission. Astronauts Scott and Irwin collected several samples during
      their EVAs. Among the rocks they collected was one that was later dubbed
      the “Genesis Rock.” It was a very pure specimen of anorthosite, a type of
      rock believed to have been a principal constituent of the moon’s
      primordial crust. Estimates of the sample’s age identify it as roughly 4.1
      billion years old (Scott and Leonov 2004, 308). The rock would later be
      the analyzed in numerous scientific studies over the following years
      (Meyer 2011).
    </Paragraph>
    <Paragraph>
      Another important objective of the mission was the experiments conducted
      on the surface of the Moon with the help of the Apollo Lunar Surface
      Experiments Package (ALSEP). The ALSEP consisted of a set of scientific
      instruments placed at the landing site by the astronauts. One of the
      components of the ALSEP, the Solar-Wind Spectrometer, measured the fluxes
      and spectra of the electrons and protons that emanate from the Sun and
      reach the lunar surface (NASA, 1971i). The ALSEP instruments were arrayed
      around a central station which supplied power to run the instruments and
      communications so data collected by the experiments could be relayed to
      Earth.
    </Paragraph>
    <Paragraph>
      Data collected from the instruments were converted into a telemetry format
      and transmitted to Earth. The ALSEP system and instruments were controlled
      by commands from Earth (NASA 1971, 19-21).

    <Paragraph>
      At the end of the final EVA, Scott performed a televised sequel to the
      experiment Galileo is purported to have conducted at the Tower of Pisa. He
      dropped a hammer and a feather together in the lunar vacuum and observed
      that they struck the ground at the same time. Commander Scott describes
      how he conducted the experiment:
    </Paragraph>
    <Blockquote>
      I wanted to prove the law, proposed more than three centuries before by
      the Italian astronomer and mathematician Galileo Galilei, that all objects
      fall with equal speed in a vacuum. Taking into one hand a falcon feather I
      had brought along for the purpose and in the other my trusty aluminium
      geology hammer, I positioned myself in front of the cameras, raised my
      arms and let both objects fall (Scott &amp; Leonov, 2004:p.273)
    </Blockquote>
    <Paragraph>
      This video that is part of the Apollo 15 Learning Hub’s collection shows
      how the feather and hammer experiment was shown on TV back on earth (NASA,
      1971l).

    <Paragraph>
      On August 2, the Lunar Module fired its ascent stage engine and lifted off
      the Moon for its rendezvous with Command Module, or CM, Endeavor. For the
      first time, the lunar liftoff was seen on Earth via the LRV television
      camera. The two spacecrafts docked as Endeavor began its 50th lunar orbit.
      On the 74th revolution, the Particles and Fields sub satellite was
      spring-launched from the service module bay (NASA 1971, 13).

      This photo shows one page of the flight plan that was used by the crew of
      Apollo 15 onboard the CSM with handwritten annotations by the crew. It
      delineates one hour of the schedule that the crew followed after Commander
      Scott and James Irwin had returned back to the CSM after their lunar
      landing (NASA, 1971g:p.114).

      While travelling back to Earth, the Apollo 15 crew had several tasks to
      complete, the first of which was to launch the sub-satellite:
    </Paragraph>
    <Blockquote>
      We still had a fairly full program of scientific experiments to perform
      during our return journey. First, before leaving lunar orbit, we had to
      deploy a small hexagonal satellite, the first sub-satellite to be launched
      in space, which would continue to orbit the Moon and send back data on its
      magnetic field for over a year (Scott &amp; Leonov, 2004:p.277).

      This small satellite was designed around a hexagonal structure 30 inches
      in length that was equipped with three instrument booms. The power supply
      came from solar panels and chemical batteries. The instruments measured
      the strength and direction of interplanetary and terrestrial magnetic
      fields, detected variations in the lunar gravity field, and measured
      proton and electron flux (NASA 1971, 257).

    <Paragraph>
      On August 5, while the CSM was on its way back to Earth, Alfred Worden had
      to perform a deep space extravehicular activity - “the first ever
      performed in deep space” (Scott &amp; Leonov, 2004:p.227).
    </Paragraph>
    <Paragraph>
      In this photo, we see Worden outside the spacecraft during his trans-Earth
      EVA. During his EVA, Worden made an inspection of the Service Module’s
      Scientific Instrument Module (SIM) bay and retrieved the film cassettes
      from the Panoramic Camera and the Mapping Camera before the SIM was
      discarded into space (NASA, 1971m).

      At approximately 4:46 p.m. EDT on August 7, Apollo 15 splashed down in the
      Pacific Ocean north of Hawaii, about 476 miles away from Honolulu, ending
      a flight of 12 days, seven hours. The USS Okinawa, a helicopter carrier,
      was supported the recovery efforts, allowing the astronauts to come back

    <StickyHeader>Conclusion</StickyHeader>
    <Paragraph>
      The return of the Apollo 15 mission included a long series of talks and
      presentations for the crew members who were informed about the
      accomplishments of their mission regarding the scientific experiments they
      had conducted, as well as the engineering and other technical
      achievements.
    </Paragraph>
    <Paragraph>
      Apollo 15 set several new records for crewed spaceflight: heaviest payload
      in a lunar orbit of approximately 107,000 pounds, maximum radial distance
      traveled on the lunar surface away from the spacecraft of about 17.5 miles
      (previous high was 2.1 miles on Apollo 14), most lunar surface EVAs
      (three) and longest total of duration for lunar surface EVAs (18 hours, 37
      minutes - almost the total time spent in lunar orbit by Apollo 8), longest
      time in lunar orbit (about 145 hours; only two hours less than the entire
      Apollo 8 mission), longest crewed lunar mission (295 hours), longest
      Apollo mission (295 hours - previous high was 244 hours, 36 minutes on
      Apollo 12), the first satellite placed in lunar orbit by a crewed
      spacecraft, and first deep space and operational EVA (NASA 1971, Apollo 15
      Mission Report).

      The samples that the mission brought back had been deemed as especially
      valuable by NASA scientists and it would turn out to be one of the more
      noteworthy contributions of the Apollo 15 mission. -Dimitri Zaras, 2021
