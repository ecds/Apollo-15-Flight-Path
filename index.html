            interesting thing. I see the whole area around Littrow, particularly - particularly in the area of Littrow
            where we've noticed the darker deposits, there are a whole series of small, almost irregular shaped cones,
            and they have a very distinct dark mantling just around those cones. It looks like a whole field of small
            cinder cones down there. And they look - well, I say - I say cinder cones, because they're somewhat
            irregular in shape. They're not all - they're not all round - they're positive features - and they have a
            very dark halo, which is mostly symmetric, but not always, around them individually.</q>

          <br>
          [Long comm break.]
          <br>
          [Al extends the probe to engage the three capture latches on the its tip with the LM's drogue. He then
          retracts the probe slightly so that it firmly grips the drogue. He then cocks the twelve docking latches
          around the rim of the tunnel ready for release. These have been holding the CSM and LM together since the
          early hours of the mission.]
          <br>
          <strong>Public Affairs Officer</strong> - <q class='uk-margin'>We have about 2 minutes now before Apollo 15 goes behind the
            Moon on the 11th
            revolution. Both spacecraft, Endeavour and Falcon, appear to be in very good shape at the moment, and we'll
            be giving the crew a Go for undocking and separation, which will occur at about 100 hours, 13 minutes, 56
            seconds; right on the scheduled Flight Plan time.</q>

          <strong><time>099:29:18</time> Mitchell:</strong> <q class='uk-margin'>Okay, Apollo 15; Houston. You're Go for undocking.
            You're 45 seconds from LOS, and we observed your rendezvous radar test. Falcon, also, we have not seen you
            reset the DAP [Digital Auto Pilot].</q>
          <br>
          <strong><time>099:29:35</time> Scott:</strong> <q class='uk-margin'>Okay, understand. I'll get the DAP reset, and the tapemeter
            looks like it works fine.</q>
          <br>
          <strong><time>099:29:40</time> Mitchell:</strong> <q class='uk-margin'>Very good, Dave. Glad to hear it.</q>
          <br>
          [The tapemeter displays the distance and distance rate in two modes. During the descent it will be the
          altitude and altitude rate meter relative to the lunar surface using data from the landing radar. During
          ascent and rendezvous, it will display the range and range rate between the Command Module and the Lunar
          Module derived from rendezvous radar data. Proper operation of the tapemeter was a concern since the initial
          inspection of the LM at 34:30 when the crew found the glass cover of the tapemeter had broken.]
          <br>
          <strong>Public Affairs Officer</strong> - <q class='uk-margin'>And we've had Loss Of Signal. That last report from Dave Scott
            that the tapemeter appears to be working well. That's the - one of the onboard indicators used to read out
            the rendezvous radar
            and also the landing radar altitude and altitude rate information, and is one of several means available to
            the crew and to the guidance system for getting that needed information. As Apollo 15 went around the
            corner,
            the spacecraft was in an orbit of 61.9 nautical miles [114.6 km] at its high point and 9.4 nautical miles
            [17.4 km] at its low point passing over the landing site. Apollo 15, Endeavour and Falcon, will be
            undocking,
            as we said, at 100 hours, 13 minutes, 56 seconds; which will be shortly before we reacquire the spacecraft
            on
            the 12th revolution. During the 12th and 13th revolutions, Al Worden will be tracking a crater near the
            landing site, Index Crater. Now this information will be used to update the knowledge of where the landing
            site is precisely and also where the spacecraft orbit is with respect to the landing site. Now this
            information will be fed into the Falcon computer just prior to powered descent. ...We'll be reacquiring in
            about 45 minutes. This is Apollo Control at 99 hours, 32 minutes.</q>
          <br>
          [As Al removes his helmet and gloves, Dave and Jim are putting theirs on in preparation for the landing.
          Aboard both spacecraft, this far-side pass is mostly spent preparing for undocking and separation. Al sets up
          a Hasselblad and a DAC (Data Acquisition Camera, the small, variable frame rate Maurer movie camera) for
          photography of the departing Lunar Module out of window 2 of the Command Module. He carries out a maneuver to
          trim the attitude of the combined stack with the CSM towards the Moon and the LM away from it. Note that this
          is only a trim to a
          maneuver carried out over two hours ago.]
          <br>
          [Dave and Jim do a suit pressure integrity check, but find it does not hold pressure well enough at the first
          try.]
          <br>
          [<strong>Irwin, from the 1971 Technical Debrief</strong> - <q class='uk-margin'>Probably our biggest surprise of the
            activation, was the pressure
            integrity check. When we obviously did not have integrity, we tried going to the secondary canister and
            still
            didn't have any integrity. We decided to press on through it and do the rate check, which we did. Then,
            later
            on, I guess it was about 10 minutes before undocking, we came back and redid the pressure integrity check.
            Of
            course, we cycled through it right from the start; and this time, it worked out great. I think we had a
            1/10th drop in 1 minute.</q>]

            DOCKING

            003:33:51 Scott: Hard dock, Houston.

            003:33:50 Fullerton: Roger.

            003:33:53 Worden (onboard): Great!

            003:33:54 Scott (onboard): Man alive!

            003:33:55 Worden (onboard): Boy! (Laughter)

            003:33:56 Scott (onboard): I should have told you about that. I forgot about it.

            003:33:57 Worden (onboard): Yes. I'm...

            003:33:58 Irwin (onboard): I didn't think we were - it was going to ... that much.

            003:33:59 Scott (onboard): Okay. Let's...

            003:34:01 Worden (onboard): I was expecting it.

            [Comm break and TV transmission ends.]

            [Once the retraction of the probe brings the two vehicles together, twelve automatic docking latches snap
            into place around the back surface of the docking flange to achieve a hard dock.]

            [As well as a small thrust forward to engage the capture latches, Al also thrust forward during the
            retraction of the probe. This seems to be a repeat of a similar maneuver first carried out on Apollo 14 by
            Stu Roosa. When 14's capture latches failed to engage with the drogue, a last ditch suggestion from Mission
            Control was to thrust forward while retracting the probe and hope the

            docking latches would engage. Al is mindful of that event and wants to make sure his docking goes well.]

            [The crew are still suited, though with helmet and gloves off, so if a pressurisation problem occurs during
            the coming procedures, they can don both and repressurise their suits. In summary, over the next quarter of
            an hour or so, the cabin pressures of the two spacecraft will be equalised, the forward hatch removed to
            gain access to the tunnel and the integrity of the dock will be confirmed by inspecting the docking
            latches.]

            [To preserve the LM consumables, the tunnel and LM are pressurised from the CM cabin oxygen via a Pressure
            Equalization valve built into the centre of the CM's forward hatch, through the tunnel and through a valve
            built into the overhead hatch of the LM. This latter valve had been deliberately left open since before
            launch to allow the LM's atmosphere to bleed away as the Saturn ascended. Now it admits CM air (O2) to the
            LM so that during the coming day, the integrity of the LM cabin can be proven in a vacuum. If, during
            pressurization, the CM pressure drops to 27.5 kPa (4.0 psi), more oxygen is fed into the CM cabin from the
            repressurisation package to replenish it and keep it above this figure.]

            [A pressure gauge beside the CM forward hatch lets Al monitor the pressure difference across the hatch and
            when this is low enough he can remove it and check the latches, one of which hasn't latched properly and
            has to be engaged manually. Two umbilical cables are connected within the tunnel to join the two spacecraft
            electrically. The hatch is reinstalled and the spacecraft prepared for its ejection from the S-IVB.]

            [According to the 1971 Mission Report - "The probe was activated to the retract position and the two
            spacecraft were hard-docked. At the completion of the docking maneuver, the forward hatch was removed and
            the latches were checked. One latch was not locked onto the docking ring. That latch was recocked and
            latched manually. The Lunar Module umbilicals were then attached, and the hatch was replaced."]

            [Scott, from the 1971 Technical Debrief - [To Worden] "Once you gave it the plus-X, I was watching the
            talkbacks, and they flipped right in the barber pole. We retracted and cinched right on down and heard a
            good bang on the latch."]

            [Worden, from the 1971 Technical Debrief - "That's very positive. Not only can you hear it, but you can
            feel it, too, when those latches go. You really know you are there."]

            [Irwin, from the 1971 Technical Debrief - "Number 3 was the one that wasn't latched. It took two strokes."]

            [Scott, from the 1971 Technical Debrief - "Yes, that's right. All of them were locked up tight except
            number 3. It took two strokes to lock it. Could you see anything hanging from the LM?"]

            [Worden, from the 1971 Technical Debrief - "I didn't see a thing."]

            [Scott, from the 1971 Technical Debrief - "You mentioned the handling characteristics. Sunlight and CSM
            docking lights must have been okay."]

            [Worden, from the 1971 Technical Debrief - "We didn't need the docking light. Everything was illuminated by
            the Sun. We didn't have any problems with shadow; no problem seeing the docking target. It was very clearly
            illuminated. We didn't use the docking lights."]

            003:34:02 Irwin (onboard): Okay; Docking Probe, Extend/Retract, and talkback's gray.

            003:34:06 Worden (onboard): Gray.

            003:34:07 Irwin (onboard): Sequence Pyro Arm, two, to Safe.

            003:34:10 Worden (onboard): Pyro Arm, Safe.

            003:34:11 Irwin (onboard): Sequence Logic, two, Off.

            003:34:13 Worden (onboard): Logic, Off.

            003:34:14 Irwin (onboard): EDS Power, Off.

            003:34:16 Worden (onboard): EDS Power's Off.

            003:34:18 Irwin (onboard): CB EDS, three, open.

            003:34:21 Worden (onboard): EDS, three, open.

            003:34:24 Irwin (onboard): Docking Probe, Extend/Release to Off.

            003:34:27 Worden (onboard): Off.

            003:34:28 Irwin (onboard): Docking Probe Retract, two, Off.

            003:34:30 Worden (onboard): Two, Off.

            003:34:31 Irwin (onboard): CB Docking Probe, two, open.

            003:34:34 Worden (onboard): Docking Probe, open. Tape Recorder's going off.

            003:36:07 Scott: Okay, Houston, [Apollo] 15.

            003:36:09 Fullerton: Go ahead.

            003:36:12 Scott: Okay; that all [the transposition and docking] went fairly nominally, and the only
            different thing we've noticed is the SPS Thrust light on the EMS is now on. And we don't know when it came
            on; somewhere in the process here.
