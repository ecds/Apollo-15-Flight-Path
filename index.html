                The Apollo 15 Learning Hub</h2>
                <p data-aos="fade-in">
                  The Apollo 15 Learning Hub is a project in the Emory Center for Digital Scholarship that has as its mission to assemble, preserve, and make available primary source records of Apollo 15 for research, education, and preservation as an example of a unique human endeavor. The Hub offers access to a digital archive of Apollo 15 onboard materials, an interactive 3D model of the Lunar Module, as well as links to reliable primary sources of Apollo history. In this section of the Apollo 15 Learning Hub, we present information about the flight path of Apollo 15 to the Moon and back. The original flight documents presented here are part of the Learning Hub’s collection and were provided by Commander David R. Scott.

                  NASA’s Apollo program started in the 1960s and continued well into the 1970s, achieving several milestones throughout its run with the Moon landing of Apollo 11 being the most famous of them. The Apollo 15 mission was part of that effort, being the ninth crewed mission of the Apollo program. The Apollo 15 mission involved several groundbreaking scientific experiments as well as innovating space travel features.

                <p data-aos="fade-in">
                  The four primary objectives of the Apollo 15 mission in terms of science and engineering were to explore the Hadley-Apennine region of the Moon, set up and activate surface scientific experiments, make engineering evaluations of new Apollo equipment, and conduct lunar orbital experiments and photographic tasks .

                  On March 26, 1970 NASA announced the crew for Apollo 15, which was planned to be the fifth Moon landing mission . The three astronauts selected for the mission were David R. Scott, the mission commander, Alfred M. Worden, and James B. Irwin.

                  The Apollo 15 crew and their backups underwent training that lasted about 20 months before their mission. Part of that training took place in Antarctica for a habitability study in January 1970, as the following video donated by Commander David Scott shows.

                  Another part of that process was geology training exercises in the Orocopia Mountains and in the Mojave Desert in California and the area around Flagstaff, Arizona. Apollo 15 would be the first mission to utilize the Lunar Roving Vehicle (LRV) to enable the astronauts to travel farther from their Lunar Module to explore areas of geologic interest.

                  The Apollo 15 mission launch date had been scheduled for July 26, 1971. The last few weeks before the launch, the astronauts’ training as it related to the launch and everything else about the mission had intensified. Every detail about the flight plan, the Command and Service Module (CSM), the plan of action after the CSM had left the Earth’s atmosphere was exhaustively examined and checked.

                  The Apollo 15 crew and their backups had been placed in quarantine for two weeks before the launch to ensure that they would not contract any viruses and that they would be in peak physical condition at the time of the flight. On the day of the launch, the crew started their day by undergoing a thorough physical exam by the Apollo 15 doctors.
                  <blockquote data-aos="fade-in">
                  After being declared in excellent physical condition we sat down to a traditional hearty breakfast with members of our back-up-crew and support team.

                  Scott, Worden, and Irwin were helped into their spacesuits several hours before the launch. They had to wait for NASA technicians to finish the final check of the launch vehicle wearing their spacesuits, which took the whole morning of that day. Finally, the three crew members entered the Command and Service Module.

              <p data-aos="fade-in">
                The ascent of the space craft was one of the most dangerous parts of the whole mission. There were a number of things that could go wrong during this phase that could force Commander Scott to take the decision to abort the mission. What made this part of the flight even more stressful was the difficulty of replicating the ascent of the CSM in a flight simulator. The time-frame within which an abort could be activated was less than a second.
                <blockquote data-aos="fade-in">
                Throughout these critical moments of our powered ascent there were various modes of aborting the launch in the evet of a major failure of any aspect of either our Apollo spacecraft or the Saturn V gulping 15 tons of fuel per second beneath us. This was one of the riskiest times of the entire mission and one for which it had been particularly difficult to train (247).

                They flew their Lunar Module to a perfect landing at 6:16 pm EST July 30 at Hadley Rille about 1,500 feet north and east of the targeted landing point. They touched down with two of the Lunar Module’s landing pads just over the edge of a small crater that the astronauts had not been able to see through the dust raised by their rocket engine, causing the lunar module to tilt. But they were stable enough to continue their mission . Landing approach over the Apennine Range - one of the highest on the moon - was at an angle of 26 degrees, the steepest approach yet used in Apollo missions.

                After they had taken some rest following their landing on the Moon, Scott and Irwin unfolded and deployed their lunar rover the following day. Specially designed for operation at 1/6 Earth’s gravity, it could carry 180 pounds of astronauts, gear and samples on the Moon (which would weigh 1,080 pounds on Earth), more than twice the rover’s weight, but risked collapse if accidentally sat upon while still on Earth. Though its range was 40 miles at speeds up to 11 mph, the astronauts were restricted to an area 3 miles from the lunar module so they could walk back if the rover broke down (Source: https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/missions/apollo-15/in-depth/).

                <blockquote data-aos="fade-in">
                Despite our maximum speed or only 7 or 8 mph, the reduced gravity and very irregular surface meant one or more of the independently suspended wheels lifted away from the surface every time we hit uneven terrain. No part of the lunar surface was totally flat or even (262).

                The Apollo 15 mission was the first one that gave astronauts astronauts to drive a car on the Moon. Having the lunar rover allowed Scott and Irwin to complete over 18 hours of exploration and to travel 17.5 miles on the Moon’s surface during the 3 days (from July 31 to August 2) they spent on the Moon. Also, the two astronauts were able to collect more than 170 pounds of lunar samples and to provide extensive oral descriptions and photographic documentation of geologic features in the vicinity of the landing site (Source: https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/apollo/missions/apollo15.html).

                  One of the most important aspect of the Apollo 15 mission was the study of the Moon’s geology, which was still not well understood at the time of the mission. Astronauts Scott and Irwin collected several samples during their EVAs. Among the rocks they collected was one that was later dubbed the “Genesis Rock.” It was a very pure specimen of anorthosite, a type of rock believed to have floated like icebergs in the magma oceans that constituted the Moon’s outer layers early in its history. It was found to be more than 4 billion years old and was the most ancient whole rock recovered from the lunar surface to that point. The prospect of finding such rocks was one reason the landing site had been selected ("Apollo 15," https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/missions/apollo-15/in-depth/).

                On Aug. 2, the Lunar Modulefired its ascent stage engine and lifted off the moon for its rendezvous with command module, or CM, Endeavor. For the first time, the lunar liftoff was seen on Earth via the LRV television camera. The two spacecraftsdocked as Endeavor began its 50th lunar orbit. On the 74th revolution, the Particles and Fields subsatellite was spring-launched from the service modulebay. On the next revolution, Aug. 4, a 2-minute, 21-second propulsion systemburn put Apollo 15 on its path back to Earth ("Apollo 15," https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/apollo/missions/apollo15.html). This photo shows one page ofthe flight plan that was used by the crew of Apollo 15 onboard the Command and Service Modulewith handwritten annotations by the crew. This photoshowsone hourof the schedule that the crew had to follow after the CommanderDavidScott and James Irwin had returned back to the CSM after their Lunar landing.

                  We still had a fairly full program of scientific experiments to perform during our return journey.

              This small satellite was designed around a hexagonal structure with a diameter of 14 inches that was equipped with three instrument booms. The power supply came from solar panels and chemical batteries. The instruments measured the strength and direction of interplanetary and terrestrial magnetic fields, detected variations in the lunar gravity field, and measured proton and electron flux ("Apollo 15," https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/missions/apollo-15/in-depth/).

                  Twelve days after blasting away from the Cape we prepared our spacecraft for landing […] one of the Endeavour’s three main parachutes collapsed shortly after it was deployed. But the remaining two were sufficient to break our fall and bring us down safely (278).

                The return of the Apollo 15 mission included a long series of talks and presentations for the crew members that were informed about the accomplishments of their mission regarding the scientific experiments they had conducted, as well as the engineering and other technical achievement of the Apollo 15 mission. Commander Scott commenting on the aftermath of the Apollo 15 mission:
                <blockquote data-aos="fade-in">
                  ... immediately on our return we went through endless debriefings about the science, engineering and operation of our mission, all of which was very interesting (280).
